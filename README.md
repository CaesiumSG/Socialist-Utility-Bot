# Installation

This bot is written to run on top of node.js. Please see https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have NodeJS installed, running `npm install` from the bot directory should install all required packages. If this command prints errors, the bot probably won't work!



## Windows Users
Please note that you must have a working C compiler and Python in your path for
`npm install` to work. The bot has been tested to work on Windows using Visual Studio 2015 Community and Python 2.7, except for `!pullanddeploy`.

Before the first run you will need to create an `.env` file. A bot token will be required for this step. 

To start the bot just run
`node bot.js`.

# FAQ
1) Module is not found

you likely need to update the node modules, try doing `npm install`, `npm update` or `npm install [the missing module]`

2) cmd.run is not defined.

Its a huge bug that i will fix after my exams so yea.


# Updates
If you update the bot, please run `npm update` before starting it again. If you have
issues with this, you can try deleting your node_modules folder and then running
`npm install` again. Please see [Installation](#Installation).
